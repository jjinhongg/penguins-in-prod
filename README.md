# penguins-in-prod

During this project, I'll create a SageMaker Pipeline to build an end-to-end Machine Learning system to solve the problem of classifying penguin species. The project is split into several sessions.

Here are the relevant notebooks:

The Setup notebook: We'll use this notebook at the beginning of the program to setup SageMaker Studio. You only need to go through the code here once.
The Penguins in Production notebook: This is the main notebook we'll use during the program. Inside you'll find the code of every session.

# Resources
- Serving a TensorFlow model from a Flask application: A simple Flask application that serves a multi-class classification TensorFlow model to determine the species of a penguin.
